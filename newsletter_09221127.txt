Hello! Here's a brief overview of the latest updates on 'US presidential election'.

### Latest Updates

1. **Election 2024 Polls: Florida**
In the run-up to the 2024 election, current polls indicate a tie between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump among likely voters nationally. However, there's a significant divergence at state levels; Harris holds a four-point lead in Pennsylvania. From mid-July, Harris has risen about six to seven points in majority of the battleground states, including nationally. Thus, the electoral results reveal a strong national support for Trump, while Harris is performing well in Northern battleground states like Pennsylvania, underscoring the significance of the Electoral College in deciding the election.

2. **Election Live Updates: Trump Says It’s ‘Too Late’ for Another Debate**
In the run-up to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Elections, former President Donald Trump has declined Vice President Kamala Harris's call for a second debate, stating early voting has already started in some states. While Harris earned favorable feedback from the initial debate, Trump has made no direct commentary on a potential second. Meanwhile, Trump-backed Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is under scrutiny for making controversial statements in the past. Reproductive rights and motherhood are central political battlegrounds, with Republicans expressing concerns about declining birthrates, and Democrats emphasize the need for improved services like affordable childcare and quality healthcare. Members of Trump's party voice concerns about security in the presidential race while dismissing claims that Democratic rhetoric was to blame for threats against Trump. The contentious link between reproductive rights and politics is further demonstrated by Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders rebuking VP Harris for not having biological children. The presidential race intensifies, with early voting and contentious issues at its heart.

3. **Georgia election board votes to require ballots be hand-counted in November**
The Georgia State Election Board decided by a 3-2 vote to enforce counties to manually count ballots from Election Day, potentially causing significant delays in tabulating results. The decision was backed by three board members commended by former President Donald Trump, but faced opposition from both Democrats and Republicans, including the secretary of state and attorney general. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed concern that the rule could create "chaos" and face legal challenges, and that it contradicts efforts made over the past six years to expedite the voting process.

First off, at a national level, voters are evenly divided between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. However, there's a discernible divide at the state level. Harris holds an advantage in Northern battleground states like Pennsylvania, a development highlighting the importance of state-wise performances in elections due to the Electoral College's influence.

Secondly, the call from Vice President Kamala Harris for a second debate with Trump has been declined by the latter in light of early voting already underway in some states.

Controversially, Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders criticized Harris for not having biological children, sparking further discourse around reproductive rights in politics.

Finally, a noteworthy development was witnessed in Georgia—its State Election Board passed a rule requiring a manual count of Election Day ballots, en route to potentially significant delays in the results tally.
