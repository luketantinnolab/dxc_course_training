"Singaporean kitefoiler Maximilian Maeder, who recently won a historic Olympic bronze medal, is preparing to resume racing in early September at the Austrian leg of the KiteFoil World Series. Maeder said he's galvanised by support from Singaporeans and is keen to compete against his rivals, even those who defeated him in Marseille. Two other Singaporean sailors, Justin Liu and Denise Lim, have been trying out wing foiling and laser racing, alongside pickleball, to stay fit while trying something new. They haven't closed the chapter on competing at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, with Liu saying they still have something to give to the sport."
