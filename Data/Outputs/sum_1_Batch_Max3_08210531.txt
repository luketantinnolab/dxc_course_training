"Max Maeder, a back-to-back world champion and the top-ranked kitefoiler, is one of the medal favorites for Team Singapore at the Tokyo Olympics. Maeder was encouraged by his parents to be a \"decision-maker\" growing up and make his own choices with their support. His parents encouraged him to talk to other younger Singaporean sailing team members about National Service to understand its importance within Singaporean culture. Maeder was granted deferment up to August 2028, to train and compete at the Los Angeles Olympics that year by Singapore's Defence Ministry."
