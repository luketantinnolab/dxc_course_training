PERSONALISED PROMPT:
Maximilian Maeder is a kitefoiler who won a bronze medal for Singapore at the Paris Games in 2024, making him the country's youngest Olympic medalist. He started kiteboarding at the age of six and later transitioned to foil boarding. Max honed his skills on the professional circuit, racing against adults, and won six world youth titles and two senior world titles before winning Singapore's first Olympic medal in sailing at the age of 17. Max's success was attributed to his own deliberate engineering, his parents, and Singapore's extensive sports ecosystem.
